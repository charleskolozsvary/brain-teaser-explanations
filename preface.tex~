\chapter*{Preface}

In December 2022 a friend of mine mentioned that a company called Jane Street posts a ``puzzle'' each month. They aren't typical puzzles, though (like a jig-saw or crossword), they are usually, rather, a fairly complicated math- and/or computer-science-oriented brain teaser. Here's the statement of that month's puzzle, \emph{Die Agony}:
\[
\input{die-agony-grid}
\]
\begin{quote}
A six-sided die, with numbers written on each of its faces, is placed on the 6-by-6 grid above, in the lower-left (yellow) corner. It then makes a sequence of ``moves''. Each move consists of tipping the die into an orthogonally adjacent square within the grid.

The die starts with a ``score'' of 0. On the $N$th move, its score increases by $N$ times the value of the die facing up after the move. However, the die is only allowed to move into a square if its score after the move matches the value in the square. Also, the die cannot be translated or rotated in place in addition to these moves.

After some number of moves the die arrives in the upper-right (blue) corner.

The answer to this puzzle is the sum of values in the unvisited squares from the die's journey.

Being the nerd I am, I was immediately hooked and worked on it nonstop until I found the solution. And if you find it interesting, too, I suggest you stop reading this right now and either try it or Jane Street's current puzzle yourself.

Needless to say, I had a lot of fun for a number of reasons, though it was especially satisfying to get to apply a bit of group theory I learned that semester. I realized I could represent the result of tipping the die in different directions on the arrangement of numbers on the die faces with members from $S_6$, the group of permutations with six elements. For example, if the top, east, north, west, south, and bottom faces of the die (from a bird's-eye view perspective) are respectively labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, tipping the die to the right corresponds to the permutation $(1264)$ in \emph{cycle notation}.\footnote{I.e., 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 6, 6 goes to 4, 4 goes to 1, and 3 and 5 don't change. See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Cycle_notation} for more.}












And when I read that month's puzzle called \emph{Die Agony}, I was immediately hooked and spent the entire weekend working on the puzzle. So if you thinkIt might be interesting to explore what makes a problem satisfying and

I spent a weekend thinking about and eventually solving that month's puzzle called \emph{Die Agony}, and I had a lot of fun. So every now and then I worked on a puzzle to tackled August 2024's \emph{Tree-edge Triage}, which was  and had so much fun solving it that I wanted   it so much that I wrote an explanation of it in \LaTeX. Though after I was finished, I realized a more rewarding (and ambitious) project would be to explain the problem and its solution for a general audience---not just those roughly familiar with undergraduate math and computer science. Not only this, but That is a tall order, though, for sure, some of Jane Street's .\footnote{Example (August 2023's Single-Cross 2): Consider 3-space (i.e.\ $\mathbf{R}^3$) partitioned into a grid of unit cubes with faces defined by the planes of all points with at least one integer coordinate. For a fixed positive real number $D$, a random line segment of length $D$ (chosen uniformly in location and orientation) is placed in this cubic lattice.

What length $D$ maximizes the probability that the endpoints of the segment lie in orthogonally adjacent unit cubes (that is, the segment crosses exactly one integer-coordinate plane), and what is this maximal probability? Give your answer as a \textbf{comma-separated pair of values to 10 significant places} (e.g.\ ``1.234567891,0.2468135792'').}

The hope is that Chapter \ref{prelim} will offer enough of an introduction to the basic but powerful (mathematical) ideas that are needed for solving these tricky but also really cool puzzles.
