# Brain teaser explanations
When I work on and eventually solve an interesting isolated question (what I have no better name for than a "brain teaser"), I usually also have
the desire to typeset its solution in LaTeX. I don't know why I do this to myself, but I just do. LaTeX makes some really pretty documents darn it.

This repository contains the LaTeX source code to solutions for several problems, but it's pretty meager right now.
I write very slowly, and I find writing very difficult. What Ernest Hemmingway said about writing resonates with me (if he really said it): 
"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed."
